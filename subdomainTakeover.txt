Subdomain Takeover:


🧠 What is Subdomain Takeover?
A subdomain takeover happens when a subdomain (like blog.example.com) points to a service (like GitHub Pages or Heroku), but that service is no longer in use — but the DNS is still pointing to it.

So you "take over" the subdomain by claiming the resource it points to.

🏗️ Key Concepts (In Simple Terms)
✅ Domain vs Subdomain
example.com → main domain

blog.example.com → subdomain

✅ CNAME Record (Simplified)
CNAME = Canonical Name
It tells DNS to redirect a subdomain to another domain.

Example:

blog.example.com CNAME myoldsite.herokuapp.com
So, when someone goes to blog.example.com, DNS says:

Go to myoldsite.herokuapp.com

🔥 When Does a Takeover Happen?
A subdomain (blog.example.com) has a CNAME to an external service (myblog.github.io)

But the target (myblog.github.io) doesn’t exist anymore

You sign up for myblog.github.io (or same name on Heroku, etc.)

DNS still points to it, so now blog.example.com points to you

💥 You control a subdomain of a real website. Critical impact.

🧪 Step-by-Step: Try to Take Over a Subdomain
🧩 Step 1: Find Subdomains
Free tool:

subfinder -d example.com -o subs.txt
Other tools: amass, assetfinder, crt.sh

🧩 Step 2: Check for CNAME Records
Run:

dig CNAME blog.example.com
Or:

host blog.example.com
If you see:

blog.example.com CNAME myblog.herokuapp.com.
That’s your target 🎯

🧩 Step 3: Visit the Subdomain
If it says something like:

No such app
There's nothing here, yet.
Repository not found.
Then it's possibly vulnerable to takeover

🧩 Step 4: Claim the Resource
Let’s say the CNAME points to myblog.github.io:

Go to GitHub

Create a repo called myblog.github.io

Add an index.html

GitHub Pages will host it

Now when people visit blog.example.com, they’ll see your page

→ You took over their subdomain
