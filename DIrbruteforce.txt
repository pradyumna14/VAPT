Direcotry-Brute force:

Directory brute force is a hacking technique used to find hidden or unlisted files and folders on a website by trying many possible names (like /admin, /login, /backup) using a wordlist. It's often done with tools like ffuf, Dirsearch, DirBuster or Gobuster.


ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u example.com/fuzz -mc 200

Here are common ffuf match/filters:

-mc → Match code (e.g., -mc 200,204)

-fc → Filter code (ignore responses like -fc 404)

-ml → Match length (e.g., -ml 100 matches response body length)

-fl → Filter length

-ms → Match string (e.g., -ms "Login")

-fs → **Filter string`

You can combine them to fine-tune results.
