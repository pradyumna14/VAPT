# VAPT


### Soo after we select a domain, we find its subdomain, and the subdomain of that subdomain, or maybe the subdomain of that subdomain of that subdomain, after finding subdomains using various tools we sort them based on uniquness, basically we eliminate the duplicate once, and after that we use HHTPX or HTTP Probe to find the active sub domains only, after we doo soo, we then do the SS of those web pages. ANd then we do Directory bruteforce on those subdomains.
